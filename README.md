# XAI-for-the-CAD-of-MDD
The script 'XAIforCADofMDD' is designed for the evaluation of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) with 10-fold cross-validation.
To implement this code, it is recommended to prepare the dataset preprocessed and segmented within 10 folds as a .mat file. The dataset should include each fold's training and testing data, including the corresponding labels.
